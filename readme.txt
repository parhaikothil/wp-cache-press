= Cache Preloading =

Our crawling bot simulates a visit to preload the cache, so your visitors get a cached version of the page loaded instantly. The indexing and ranking of your website by search engines is improved too.

= Sitemap Preloading =

To ensure that your site's cache is always warm, we automatically detect sitemaps of Yoast SEO, All In One SEO and Jetpack, then we preload all the URLs in your XML sitemap.

= Page Caching =

Caching creates an ultra-fast load time, essential for improving Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and increasing conversions.

= Browser Caching =

With browser caching, static contents (JS, CSS, images) are stored in the browser. When a visitor goes to another page on your website, your static content doesn't need to be loaded again.

= Static Files (GZIP) Compression =

Optimize the rendering of web browsers and save bandwidth (gzip compression, expires headers, etags).

= Minification and Concatenation =

Reduce the weight of your HTML, JavaScript and CSS files by using minification. Lighter files - faster load time!

= LazyLoad =

Images, iframes and videos are loaded only as your visitor scrolls down the page, improving the load time of the page.

= Google Fonts Optimization =

Less HTTP requests for a faster website.

= Deferred JS Loading =

JavaScript files are loaded after the end of the rendering of the page - the loading time of your website will be reduced.

= Remove Query Strings from Static Resources =

By removing query strings from CSS/JS files, it will improve your GT Metrix grade. Cache busting is retained by encoding the version number into the URL.
